            <p class="lead">Hi! I'm Swati- an international student from Kathmandu, Nepal. I received my undergraduate degree in Biology (B.S) from Lafayette College, PA in 2023. <br><br>I started working with Abhi during my first lab rotation as an umbrella student in the UConn Health PhD program in Biomedical Science. Given my interest in cell biology and microscopy, I wanted to further learn more about how cells interact with their environment and how the cytoskeleton mediates this adaptation. <br><br>Apart from thinking about cellular mechanisms, I also enjoy hiking, reading books, writing and learning new things! Oh yes- and listening to podcasts!</p>
